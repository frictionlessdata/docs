# FrictionlessData Docs


Welcome to the FrictionlessData Developer Hub!

## Overview

> For higher level project overview please visit https://frictionlessdata.io/

Frictionless Data shortens the path from data to insight with a collection of specifications and software for the publication, transport, and consumption of data. At the heart of our approach is a deep understanding of the multi-faceted nature of data work, and an emphasis on platform-agnostic interoperability. From consumer spreadsheet software, through to cloud-based services for data analysis, the future of data is frictionless.

## Implement

All getting started/tutorial code snippets should be multilanguage like this:

<!-- tabs:start -->
#### **Python**

```python
package = Package()
```
#### **JavaScript**

```javascript
const packagePackage = await Package.load()
```
<!-- tabs:end -->

While API references should be single language (obviously).
