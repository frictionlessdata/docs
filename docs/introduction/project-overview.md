# Project overview

Principles
1. Focused: Focus on one part of the data chain, one specific feature (e.g. packaging), and a few specific types of data (e.g. tabular).

2. Web-oriented: Build for the web using formats that work naturally with HTTP such as JSON, a common data exchange format for web APIs, and CSV, which is easily streamable.

3. Distributed: Design for a distributed ecosystem with no centralized, single point of failure or dependence.

4. Open: Make things that anyone can freely and openly use and reuse with a community that is open to everyone.

5. Built Around Existing Software: Integrate with existing software while also designing for direct use---for example, when a Tabular Data Package integration is unavailable, fall back to CSV.

6. Simple: Keep the formats and metadata simple and lightweight, and make things easy to learn and use by doing the least required.
