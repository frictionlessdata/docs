# Introduction

At its core, [Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io/) is a set of [specifications](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/) for data and metadata interoperability, accompanied by a collection of [software libraries](https://frictionlessdata.io/software/) that implement these specifications, and a range of best practices for data management. The core specification, the Data Package, is a simple and practical “container” for data and metadata.
