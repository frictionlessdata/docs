# FrictionlessData Docs

Welcome to the FrictionlessData Documentation Hub!

> November 2019 Update: This documentation site is a work in progress. Please check out https://frictionlessdata.io/docs/ for more help in the interim.

## Overview


Frictionless Data shortens the path from data to insight with a collection of specifications and software for the publication, transport, and consumption of data. At the heart of our approach is a deep understanding of the multi-faceted nature of data work, and an emphasis on platform-agnostic interoperability. From consumer spreadsheet software, through to cloud-based services for data analysis, the future of data is frictionless. For higher level project overview please visit https://frictionlessdata.io/

<!-- commenting out everything else below because I don't think it should be on the main page, but I'm keeping it for reference for now
  
## Implement

All getting started/tutorial code snippets should be multilanguage like this: -->

<!-- tabs:start -->
<!-- #### **Python**

```python
package = Package()
```
#### **JavaScript**

```javascript
const packagePackage = await Package.load()
```-->
<!-- tabs:end -->

<!-- While API references should be single language (obviously).
