## Getting Started

### Installation

The package use semantic versioning. It means that major versions  could include breaking changes. It's highly recommended to specify `package` version range in your `setup/requirements` file e.g. `package>=1.0,<2.0`.

```bash
pip install tableschema-spss
```

### Examples

Code examples in this readme requires Python 3.3+ interpreter. You could see even more example in [examples](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-spss-py/tree/master/examples) directory.

> For this example your schema should be compatible with SPSS storage - https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-spss-py#creating-sav-files

```python
from tableschema import Table

# Load and save table to SPSS
table = Table('data.csv', schema='schema.json')
table.save('data', storage='spss', base_path='dir/path')
```

## Documentation

The whole public API of this package is described here and follows semantic versioning rules. Everyting outside of this readme are private API and could be changed without any notification on any new version.

### Storage

Package implements [Tabular Storage](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-py#storage) interface (see full documentation on the link):

![Storage](https://i.imgur.com/RQgrxqp.png)

This driver provides an additional API:

#### `Storage(base_path=None)`

- `base_path (str)` - a valid directory path where .sav files can be created and read. If no base_path is provided, the Storage object methods will accept file paths rather than bucket names.

#### `storage.buckets`

List all .sav and .zsav files at base path. Bucket list is only maintained if Storage has a valid base path, otherwise will return None.

- `(str[]/None)` - returns bucket list or None

#### With a base path

We can get storage with a specified base path this way:

```python
from tableschema_spss import Storage

storage_base_path = 'path/to/storage/dir'
storage = Storage(storage_base_path)
```

We can then interact with storage buckets ('buckets' are SPSS .sav/.zsav files in this context):

```python
storage.buckets  # list buckets in storage
storage.create('bucket', descriptor)
storage.delete('bucket')  # deletes named bucket
storage.delete()  # deletes all buckets in storage
storage.describe('bucket') # return tableschema descriptor
storage.iter('bucket') # yields rows
storage.read('bucket') # return rows
storage.write('bucket', rows)
```

#### Without a base path

We can also create storage without a base path this way:

```python
from tableschema_spss import Storage

storage = Storage()  # no base path argument
```

Then we can specify SPSS files directly by passing their file path (instead of bucket names):

```python
storage.create('data/my-bucket.sav', descriptor)
storage.delete('data/my-bucket.sav')  # deletes named file
storage.describe('data/my-bucket.sav') # return tableschema descriptor
storage.iter('data/my-bucket.sav') # yields rows
storage.read('data/my-bucket.sav') # return rows
storage.write('data/my-bucket.sav', rows)
```

Note that storage without base paths does not maintain an internal list of buckets, so calling `storage.buckets` will return `None`.

#### Reading .sav files

When reading SPSS data, SPSS date formats, `DATE`, `JDATE`, `EDATE`, `SDATE`, `ADATE`, `DATETIME`, and `TIME` are transformed into Python `date`, `datetime`, and `time` objects, where appropriate.

Other SPSS date formats, `WKDAY`, `MONTH`, `MOYR`, `WKYR`, `QYR`, and `DTIME` are not supported for native transformation and will be returned as strings.

#### Creating .sav files

When creating SPSS files from Table Schemas, `date`, `datetime`, and `time` field types must have a format property defined with the following patterns:

- `date`: `%Y-%m-%d`
- `datetime`: `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`
- `time`: `%H:%M:%S.%f`

Table Schema descriptors passed to `storage.create()` should include a custom `spss:format` property, defining the SPSS type format the data is expected to represent. E.g.:

```json
{
    "fields": [
        {
            "name": "person_id",
            "type": "integer",
            "spss:format": "F8"
        },
        {
            "name": "name",
            "type": "string",
            "spss:format": "A10"
        },
        {
            "type": "number",
            "name": "salary",
            "title": "Current Salary",
            "spss:format": "DOLLAR8"
        },
        {
           "type": "date",
           "name": "bdate",
           "title": "Date of Birth",
           "format": "%Y-%m-%d",
           "spss:format": "ADATE10"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Contributing

The project follows the [Open Knowledge International coding standards](https://github.com/okfn/coding-standards).

Recommended way to get started is to create and activate a project virtual environment.
To install package and development dependencies into active environment:

```
$ make install
```

To run tests with linting and coverage:

```bash
$ make test
```

For linting `pylama` configured in `pylama.ini` is used. On this stage it's already
installed into your environment and could be used separately with more fine-grained control
as described in documentation - https://pylama.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

For example to sort results by error type:

```bash
$ pylama --sort <path>
```

For testing `tox` configured in `tox.ini` is used.
It's already installed into your environment and could be used separately with more fine-grained control as described in documentation - https://testrun.org/tox/latest/.

For example to check subset of tests against Python 2 environment with increased verbosity.
All positional arguments and options after `--` will be passed to `py.test`:

```bash
tox -e py27 -- -v tests/<path>
```

Under the hood `tox` uses `pytest` configured in `pytest.ini`, `coverage`
and `mock` packages. This packages are available only in tox envionments.
