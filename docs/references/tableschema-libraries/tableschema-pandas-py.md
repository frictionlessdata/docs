## Getting Started

### Installation

The package use semantic versioning. It means that major versions  could include breaking changes. It's highly recommended to specify `package` version range in your `setup/requirements` file e.g. `package>=1.0,<2.0`.

```
$ pip install tableschema-pandas
```

### Example

Code examples in this readme requires Python 3.3+ interpreter. You could see even more example in [examples](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-pandas-py/tree/master/examples) directory.

You can easily load resources from a data package as Pandas data frames by simply using `datapackage.push_datapackage` function:

```python
>>> import datapackage

>>> data_url = 'http://data.okfn.org/data/core/country-list/datapackage.json'
>>> storage = datapackage.push_datapackage(data_url, 'pandas')

>>> storage.buckets
['data___data']

>>> type(storage['data___data'])
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>

>>> storage['data___data'].head()
             Name Code
0     Afghanistan   AF
1   Ã…land Islands   AX
2         Albania   AL
3         Algeria   DZ
4  American Samoa   AS
```

Also it is possible to pull your existing data frame into a data package:

```python
>>> datapackage.pull_datapackage('/tmp/datapackage.json', 'country_list', 'pandas', tables={
...     'data': storage['data___data'],
... })
Storage
```

## Documentation

The whole public API of this package is described here and follows semantic versioning rules. Everyting outside of this readme are private API and could be changed without any notification on any new version.

### Storage

Package implements [Tabular Storage](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-py#storage) interface (see full documentation on the link):

![Storage](https://i.imgur.com/RQgrxqp.png)

This driver provides an additional API:

#### `Storage(dataframes=[])`

- `dataframes (object[])` - list of storage dataframes

We can get storage this way:

```python
>>> from tableschema_pandas import Storage

>>> storage = Storage()
```

Storage works as a container for Pandas data frames. You can define new data frame inside storage using `storage.create` method:

```python
>>> storage.create('data', {
...     'primaryKey': 'id',
...     'fields': [
...         {'name': 'id', 'type': 'integer'},
...         {'name': 'comment', 'type': 'string'},
...     ]
... })

>>> storage.buckets
['data']

>>> storage['data'].shape
(0, 0)
```

Use `storage.write` to populate data frame with data:

```python
>>> storage.write('data', [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')])

>>> storage['data']
id comment
1        a
2        b
```

Also you can use [tabulator](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tabulator-py) to populate data frame from external data file. As you see, subsequent writes simply appends new data on top of existing ones:

```python
>>> import tabulator

>>> with tabulator.Stream('data/comments.csv', headers=1) as stream:
...     storage.write('data', stream)

>>> storage['data']
id comment
1        a
2        b
1     good
```

## Contributing

The project follows the [Open Knowledge International coding standards](https://github.com/okfn/coding-standards).

Recommended way to get started is to create and activate a project virtual environment.
To install package and development dependencies into active environment:

```
$ make install
```

To run tests with linting and coverage:

```bash
$ make test
```

For linting `pylama` configured in `pylama.ini` is used. On this stage it's already
installed into your environment and could be used separately with more fine-grained control
as described in documentation - https://pylama.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

For example to sort results by error type:

```bash
$ pylama --sort <path>
```

For testing `tox` configured in `tox.ini` is used.
It's already installed into your environment and could be used separately with more fine-grained control as described in documentation - https://testrun.org/tox/latest/.

For example to check subset of tests against Python 2 environment with increased verbosity.
All positional arguments and options after `--` will be passed to `py.test`:

```bash
tox -e py27 -- -v tests/<path>
```

Under the hood `tox` uses `pytest` configured in `pytest.ini`, `coverage`
and `mock` packages. This packages are available only in tox envionments.
